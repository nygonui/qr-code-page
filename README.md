## Overview
### Links

- The GitHub page from this projet: [QR Code Page](https://nygonui.github.io/qr-code-component-main/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In a large part of this project I applied concepts that I have studied for some time, such as those mentioned in [Built with](#built-with). But in this work I used relative measures other than the percentage, such as `vh, vw and rem`, which I had not used in other projects.
### Continued development

Working on this simple project I see that I need improve my tecniques with flex-box and responsive design and practice more rsrsrs.
